  Hi, my name's Pierre. I am a full stack web developer with 15 years of experience, based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and ultimately fell in love with <mark>TypeScript</mark>. In my career I have aquired experience in leading teams, product development, agile methodologies, building companies, working with clients and customers.

  I love to share my passion for <mark>Clean Code</mark> and <mark>Maintainable CSS</mark>.  I am currently mostly fluent with the following technologies:

  <mark>TypeScript</mark>
  <mark>JavaScript</mark>
  <mark>React & Redux</mark>
  <mark>Vue</mark>
  <mark>Angular</mark>
  <mark>Jest</mark>
  <mark>Express</mark>
  <mark>GraphQL</mark>
  <mark>PostgreSQL</mark>
  <mark>SASS</mark>
  <mark>Docker</mark>

  Most of all, I believe that clean and maintainable code is a side-effect of continuously evolving and adapting the <mark>development process</mark>. Simple tools like code reviews, pair programming, git flow, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automated testing are often easy to implement and have a tremendous effect on long-term productivity of a team.
