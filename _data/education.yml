    My time at the University of Fribourg provided me with a good theoretical foundation in computer science and gave me a toolset I still regularly find myself using.

    In parallel I discovered the web, which took me by surprise. Combining the theoretical knowledge from the classes with the down-to-earth experience in the early days of the web was a fantastic experience. While most of my student colleagues pursued a masters degree, I chose to go into web development full-time. A decision I never regretted.
